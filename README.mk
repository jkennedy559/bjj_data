Goal: Build a Database with granular match results information

Data points to scrape
* Match competitors - John Smith vs Rupert Jones
* Full video timelength
* Competitor affiliation - John Smith = RGA
* Match result
* Scores on the board - needs a photoshoot then text extraction 
* Competitor belt and weight
* Bracket Stage
* Weight or absolute

Thoughts
* Extract flo-splotlight tags and experiment with extraction
